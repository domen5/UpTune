<p align="justify"> 
UpTune is an Android app designed to provide music lovers with a platform to "purchase" and listen to their favorite songs and albums digitally. 

The app features an extensive music library that includes a wide range of genres, from classical to pop and everything in between.
Users can purchase individual songs or full albums and store them in their personal music collection within the app.
The music can be downloaded and listened offline, providing users with the flexibility to listen to their favorite tunes anytime and anywhere.
